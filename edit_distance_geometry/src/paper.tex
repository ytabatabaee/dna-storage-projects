different types of edit distance

it's wikipedia page has very very nice things


\section*{Levenshtein Distance}
definition

how do we visualize it

distribution of edit distance between two random strings

how does levenstein space look like

difference between rimennian geometry and euclidean

all of them can be formed into a graph problem using a matrix where the cost of non existent operations is infinity

shortest path in a dag problem

a matrix where it's mid-lines are 

all of them map to finding the shortest path in a matrix

k-bounded edit distance

\section*{Hamming Distance}

how do you see it?

some form of visualization

hamming distance cube

\section*{Ulam Distance}

\section*{Applications in DNA Data Storage}

or more precisely approximate trace reconstruction

penalizing it as a cost metric

when you try to minimize some metric

when your algorithm tries to minimize some metric, if you can assume that it's error is bounded, you can also assume that the distribution of it's error is on average something good 

their applications to dna storage and especially trace reconstruction
